BloggableMVC
============

A library of utilities for developing a blogging site as part of an ASP.NET MVC application.

The bloggable utilities can be used in two ways:

1. An existing domain model or view model can be wrapped inside a SmartBloggable object in order to provide some basic blog content markup behaviour. The wrapped model must implement the IBloggable interface.

2. Alternatively, the SmartBloggable methods can be used indirectly via the HtmlHelper extension methods within the namespace Com.GriffithsBen.BloggableMVC.Extensions.

Blog content can be marked up with simple, safe tags which are then converted into equivalent HTML tags by the SmartBloggable wrapper. The list of tags to be used is entirely up to the developer. The default tags (so far) are as follows:

tag | html equivalent
--- | ---
`[b]` | `<em>`
`[i]` | `<i>`
`[p]` | `<p>`
`[quote]` | `<blockquote>`

The list of tags can be modified, extended, or replaced entirely at an Application or instance level.
